After running a gap filling step for the Discovar dataset (step 10), we could proceed to run the AlignGraph software to improve our *de novo* assembled genome.  
AlignGraph was run using the following command:  
```console  
joao_nunes@lf2-genome-assembly-discovar:~/align_graph/lf2$ AlignGraph --read1 LF2-A_ACAGTG_R1_001.fasta --read2 LF2-A_ACAGTG_R2_001.fasta --contig ../../abyss-sealer-kmer128/a.lines.gap-filled.fasta_scaffold.fa --genome ../LF.genome.fasta --distanceLow 250 --distanceHigh 1500 --extendedContig lf2-after-AlignGraph-extendedContig.fasta --remainingContig lf2-after-AlignGraph-remainingContig.fasta  
```  
The *distanceLow* and *distanceHigh* parameters were set based on AlignGraph's recomentations and considering a read size of 250 bp.  

#### Predicted run time  
According to AlignGraph's paper, the run time for a run ranges from 23â€“57 min per million aligned reads. Considering a number of 446 million reads (223 pairs), the run time may range from 171 hours (7 days) to 423 hours (17 days).  

#### 02/22/2019  
AlignGraph run has failed, probably due to the BLAT version installed on the VM instance not being compatible with AlignGraph. To solve this issue, we re-run AlignGraph using NUCMER (by adding the flag --fastMap) as an aligner tool instead of BLAT. This should also make the alignment faster (at cost of lesser sensitivity):  

```console  
joao_nunes@lf2-genome-assembly-discovar:~/align_graph/lf2$ AlignGraph --read1 LF2-A_ACAGTG_R1_001.fasta --read2 LF2-A_ACAGTG_R2_001.fasta --contig ../../abyss-sealer-kmer128/a.lines.gap-filled.fasta_scaffold.fa --genome ../LF.genome.fasta --distanceLow 250 --distanceHigh 1500 --extendedContig lf2-after-AlignGraph-extendedContig.fasta --remainingContig lf2-after-AlignGraph-remainingContig.fasta --fastMap 2>&1 | tee log_alignGraph_lf2.txt;sudo poweroff  
```  
PS: the end of the command (from *2>&1* on) is turning down the VM instance as soon as AlignGraph finishes (successfully or not) but at the same time saving its terminal output to a log file called *log_alignGraph_lf2.txt*
