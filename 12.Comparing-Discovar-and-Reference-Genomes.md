#### Align current reference and Discovar assemblies using NUCMER4
In paralel with running AlignGraph to improve Discovar's LF-2 assembly, we are running a genome-scale alignment of our current reference genome (assembled by Marcela) and the Discovar assembly (after Sealer gap-filling step).  
The program used to run the alignment was *NUCMER4*:  

```console  
joao_nunes@lf2-genome-assembly-discovar:~/nucmer-Marcela-vs-Discovar$ nucmer4 --threads=8 ../align_graph/LF.genome.fasta ../abyss-sealer-kmer128/a.lines.gap-filled.fasta_scaffold.fa 2>&1 | tee log_nucmer4_Marcela_vs_Discovar.txt  
```  

#### Where is the process running?  
On lf2-genome-assembly-discovar, at the same time as the AlignGraph process.

#### Estimated run time  
According to [MUMMER4 paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5802927/), the time taken to run an alignment of human and chipanzee genomes was 207 minutes. However, they have used 32 threads, as opposed to our 8 threads. On the other side, the human and chimpanzee genomes are smaller than *limnoperna fortunei*. Let's be pessimist and estimate 12 hours.
