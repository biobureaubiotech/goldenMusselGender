### [How much compute power do you need for next-gen sequencing?](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/how-much-compute-ngs.html) ###
- "During our next-gen course, a "student" (really a professor from Australia ;) asked me if I could provide some guidance on 
what computational infrastructure was necessary to handle next-gen sequencing data. While we used Amazon Web Services during 
the course, she was interested in finding out if they could use their local HPC, or some other dedicated compute center, to 
process their data."
