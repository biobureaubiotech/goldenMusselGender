#Getting the sequencing files
The innovation center that sequenced the genomes (POLO Dâ€™INNOVAZIONE DI GENOMICA, GENETICA E BIOLOGIA) sent the data in a HD. However, the 
HD was held at the Customs and the taxes we would have to pay to retrieve it were too high. So we suggested Laura Chiti (innovation 
center's representative) to share the files via Google Cloud. 

The fisrt attempt was to create a virtual machine to function as a FTP server. Then, Laura could upload the sequencing files after 
connecting to the FTP link and registering the user credentials. However, we could not establish the server since external access was
repeatdly blocked by the virtual machine's firewall.

Another way of sharing files through GCloud is by using the Google Cloud Storage service. The idea is to create a bucket and share it with
other users, so that they can upload/download files to it. The bucket was created (named "biobureau-upload") and shared doing the following
steps (assuming you have Goodle Cloud SDK installed in your machine):  

	1) Create a bucket where the files will be stored
		- gsutil mb gs://biobureau-upload
	2) Give permissions for another user to read/write from/to the bucket
		- gsutil acl ch -u googleaccount@gmail.com:W gs://biobureau-upload
		Important: the user to whom the bucket is being shared need to be a Google Account

After these two steps, the user invited to collaborate in the bucket should be able to access through the link:
https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/name-of-the-bucket

Which should be, for the bucket created:
https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/biobureau-upload

A login page should be prompted and after logging in the user is forwarded to the bucket's page at Google Cloud Console. Now uploading files
is a simple matter of clicking on the upload button.
